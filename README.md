## <ins>About</ins>
For this project, I have created an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on the criteria they select, from a range of different options. This app will run in the browser. 
<br> <br>

## <ins>How does the application work?</ins>
1. Click on 'Generate Password' button.

2. You are then asked, how long you wish the password to be.

Present a series of prompts for password criteria:

Length of password:

At least 8 characters but no more than 128.

Character types:

Lowercase

Uppercase

Numeric

Special characters ($@%&*, etc.)

Code should validate for each input and at least one character type should be selected.

Once all prompts are answered, the password should be generated and displayed in an alert or written to the page.
